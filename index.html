    <div id="container">
    <p>The Computer case is nothing more than a fancy looking box that holds all of the PC’s components. It can be opened and closed and usually has pre-defined areas with screws and holes where all the other Components are supposed to be placed and attached to. PC Cases come in different colors, sizes, with or without fans, some have LED lights some don’t, some have glass side panels, some others look absolutely crazy.</br></br>Usually, you can think of a PC Case as a black (or white) Box with some buttons on top. This is where <strong>all of your components will fit into</strong>, when you are done with building your PC. You don’t actually need a case, you could also just lay all of your components on the floor or mount them on the wall, some people do, but being able to just pick up the entire Computer by picking up the Case comes in handy at times.</p>

    <p>Next up is a very important part, the Mainboard. The Mainboard (or also called Motherboard) is a Printed Circuit Board that <strong>every other Computer Hardware Component will be attached to</strong>. It is like a central Hub that manages all the other Parts. </br></br>The Motherboard has connectors for cables like power cables and data cables, slots for cards like GPUs & sockets for CPUs. </br></br>There are also lots of little building blocks like transistors, capacitors, jumpers and lots of other tiny parts, that all go towards making your <strong>different hardware components work well together</strong>.</p>

    <p>Now, into the Mainboard Socket, the CPU is plugged in. Every <strong>CPU type has a specific Socket</strong>, that is named like 2066, 1151, AM4, TR4 and so on, and the mainboard will need the exact same socket to be compatible with the CPU. </br></br>This is usually the <strong>first step in picking new parts for your own pc build</strong>. Pick a CPU, check what socket it has, and then pick a compatible Mainboard. Continue on from there. </br></br>A CPU is the Central Processing Unit of a Computer, and without it, nothing really works. Almost everything you do on a Computer will have to be calculated by the CPU in some way, so having a fast CPU (high clocks and high core count) will make your PC faster.</p>

    <p>Next up is the Graphics Card. Its purpose is the calculation of anything having to do with <strong>visuals and outputs these visuals (Images, User Interface, GUI) onto the Monitor</strong>.</br></br>There are two main types of GPUs, the integrated GPU (iGPU) and a discrete GPU.</br></br><strong>The integrated GPU is integrated into the CPU</strong>. This means, some CPUs already have a graphics chip built in and you will not need an additional GPU to attach a monitor to.</br></br>When your CPU has integrated Graphics (like the Intel i7 8700K CPU) <strong>it will output to the display Adapter on the Mainboard</strong>. The thing with integrated GPUs though is, that they are very limited.</br></br>They are usually good enough for light tasks such as Word-Processing, some minor Games and the like but as soon as you want to dive into graphic-heavy tasks such as 3D GPU Rendering, High-End Gaming, Video Editing, Graphic Design or lots of others <strong>you will have to get yourself a discrete GPU</strong>.</br></br><strong>A discrete GPU is a GPU that is not part of the CPU</strong>. It usually comes on its own little Printed Circuit Board, that is then <strong>plugged into a PCI Express Slot on your Mainboard</strong>.</br></br>The two Manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD are fighting a fierce battle in getting a lead over the other, but at the moment it seems as though <strong>NVIDIA would be the Brand to pick</strong> over AMD if you are looking <strong>for the maximum performance</strong> you can get out of a GPU.</p>

    <div id="container">
    <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is the <strong>temporary thinking storage</strong> part of the Computer if you would compare it to a brain.</br></br>The RAM stores Data that is actively being worked on by the CPU. It can read and write very fast but <strong>loses everything it had stored once the power is turned off</strong>.</br></br>RAM kits consist of RAM Modules. You can get just one Module or 2 Modules / 4 Modules or even 8 Modules for Mainboards that support this many RAM Modules.</br></br>A Mainboard has RAM slots where RAM gets plugged in to. RAM comes in different sizes starting around 4GB and going up to 32GB per Module on current systems. Having more Modules of course will multiply your RAM amount.</p>

    <p>Because RAM can’t store anything without power and we <strong>do want to be able to turn off our computer from time to time</strong>, we need a storage medium that retains its stored data, even when the power is off.</br></br><strong>There are 3 main mass-storage types:</strong></br></br>The HDD, the SSD and quite a new type of SSD, the <strong>NVME SSD</strong>.</br></br>An HDD (which still has mechanically moving parts) is the slowest of the three and will usually read and save Data at about 100MByte/s.</br></br>An SSD will already read and write at around 500MByte/s and an NVME SSD currently reads and writes sequential Data with up to 3500MBytes/s.</br></br>Both HDDs and SSDs are <strong>plugged into a SATA plug onto the Mainboard via a SATA Cable</strong>. They also need Power that they get through a Power Cable from the PSU (Power Supply Unit, I’ll talk about that later!)</br></br>The NVME SSD though is just plugged into the Mainboard directly, it is very small and needs no extra cables.</br></br>Your Mainboard, of course, has to support NVME SSDs and have an M.2 Slot available. But almost all modern Mainboards nowadays have at least one of these.</br></br><strong><em>Highly recommended!</em></strong></p>

    <p>Anything that draws power also produces heat and the <strong>CPU produces lots of heat</strong>.</br></br>This means it has to be cooled to be able to operate flawlessly. What do we need for cooling a CPU? A CPU-Cooler! 🙂</br></br>Make sure you have a CPU-Cooler that is compatible with your CPU and Socket. It is the same as with Mainboard Socket and CPU Socket. <strong>The Cooler has to fit the CPU and Socket</strong>.</br></br>The air-cooled tower CPU cooler is great at cooling short performance bursts, is <strong>nice and quiet and needs less room</strong> in the case. It is simply placed on top of the CPU where it sits and goes about its cooling-work.</p>

    <p>We have got ourselves a bunch of nice PC Components already, but nothing much usually happens <strong>without a power supply to supply power</strong>.</br></br>There are so many PSU brands with different wattage or efficiencies out there, that it <strong>can be quite difficult to decide which one to buy</strong>.</br></br>The important thing is to know how much Wattage your current PC Build will need to run stable and maybe how much you will need in the future if you are planning on adding more components, like extra GPUs or Drives.</br></br>You should then of course (now already) buy a stronger power supply, <strong>that will later also be able to handle the extra components</strong>.</br></br>If you are unsure of <strong>how much Wattage your current or future PC Build actually needs</strong> head on over to the <strong>Wattage Calculator here</strong> that tells you exactly how much you need.</br></br><strong>That’s about it for our Computer Case.</strong> Everything that goes into the Case we have already discussed.

    <p>You will, of course, need some kind of display device such as a monitor <strong>to be able to see what’s going on</strong>. Monitors come in all kinds of sizes, color, resolutions, aspect ratios and so on.</br></br>A popular modern Display usually is a 24” Full HD Monitor from Brands such as Asus, Dell, LG, and many others.</br></br>If you are looking for a Gaming monitor you <strong>might not need the IPS type Panels</strong> that have better color display and contrast.</br></br>If you are into <strong>Graphic Design</strong> and Professional <strong>Color grading</strong> or <strong>Video Editing</strong> you should probably <strong>invest more into a good Monitor</strong>.</br></br>The Monitor is attached to either the discrete GPU or the Mainboard, depending on what type of GPU you have.</br></br><strong><em>Don’t forget a Mouse and Keyboard!</em></strong> 🙂 There are lots of other Input devices such as Graphic Tablets or Pens that you can also use, of course.</br></br>That’s pretty much it. You now have all the parts needed to build a PC. To actually assemble a PC you will need a <strong>Phillips head screwdriver</strong> (a magnetic one for finding those dropped screws) and you are all set!</p>

    <p>Windows 10 is the currently leading Operating System that will operate your PC-System. <strong>Lots of online Stores offer Volume License Keys</strong> that usually don’t cost you more than 15$ per license.<br></br>Of course, you will need to install the OS onto your Computer.</br></br>There are several ways to do this. You can use a DVD, but of course, you will need a DVD Player. <strong>Nowadays the OS is usually either downloaded directly from the Internet</strong> or you are given a USB Drive that you can install Win10 from.</p>
